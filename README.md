DeepSeek-R1 Local Inference
This project provides a simple setup to run the DeepSeek-R1 model locally on your machine. It supports both GPU (with CUDA) and CPU environments.

Prerequisites
Before running the model, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

pip (Python package manager)

Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

Installation
Clone the repository (optional):

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install torch transformers
If you have a GPU and want to use CUDA, install the GPU version of PyTorch:

bash
Copy
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
If you only have a CPU, install the CPU-only version of PyTorch:

bash
Copy
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
Running the Model
On GPU
If your machine has a GPU with CUDA support, the model will automatically use the GPU for faster inference.

Run the inference script:

bash
Copy
python run_deepseek_r1.py
Example output:

Copy
Loading model...
Model loaded successfully.
Generating response...
Response: "I am DeepSeek-R1, a large language model designed to assist with various tasks."
On CPU
If your machine does not have a GPU, the model will run on the CPU. Note that this will be slower compared to GPU inference.

Run the inference script:

bash
Copy
python run_deepseek_r1.py
Example output:

Copy
Loading model...
Model loaded successfully.
Generating response...
Response: "I am DeepSeek-R1, a large language model designed to assist with various tasks."
Performance Considerations
GPU: For the best performance, use a machine with a CUDA-compatible GPU. Ensure you have the correct version of PyTorch with CUDA support installed.

CPU: Running the model on a CPU is possible but will be significantly slower, especially for large models like DeepSeek-R1. Ensure your machine has sufficient RAM (at least 16GB recommended).

Troubleshooting
1. CUDA Not Available
If you have a GPU but PyTorch is not detecting it, ensure you have installed the correct version of PyTorch with CUDA support. Verify CUDA availability:

python
Copy
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return True
2. Out of Memory
If you encounter out-of-memory errors, try reducing the model's batch size or using a smaller model.

3. Slow Performance on CPU
If the model is running too slowly on your CPU, consider upgrading your hardware or using a smaller model.
